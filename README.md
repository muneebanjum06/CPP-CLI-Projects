# C++ Console Projects Collection

This repository contains a set of C++ console-based applications, each developed using file handling techniques. Every project is neatly organized in its own folder, containing the `.cpp` source code and `.txt` files used for data storage.

## 📁 Included Projects

### 1. 🏥 Hospital Management System
A basic CLI application to manage patient records, appointments, and staff details. It uses file handling to store and retrieve patient data efficiently.

### 2. 🎓 University Management System
A console-based tool to manage university records such as student enrollment, courses, and faculty. All data is handled via external `.txt` files for persistence.

### 3. 👾 PacMan (Text-Based)
A simple text-based PacMan game where the player navigates a maze using keyboard inputs. The layout and game state are stored using file streams.

### 4. 🚀 Space Shooter (ASCII-Based)
A command-line shooter game where players control a spaceship and avoid or shoot falling obstacles. The game logic and scoring system rely on file handling.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
